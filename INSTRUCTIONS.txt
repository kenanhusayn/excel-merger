1) rename the files to:
"merge-file-1.xlsx", "merge-file-2.xlsx"

"merge-file-1.xlsx" is the file that starts with the column "Page"
"merge-file-2.xlsx" is the other one

2) make sure the execute.exe program is in the same folder with the files:
|folder
|-- merge-file-1.xlsx
|-- merge-file-2.xlsx
|-- execute.exe

3) double click the execute.exe file and wait a while (up to a minute depending on the file size and the computer speed)

4) enjoy!
